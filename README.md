A basic interpreter implemented in Python to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of programming languages. It develops a simple programming language by adding arithmetic operations, condition statements, and loops. While creating lexical analysis, parsing, and execution components for the QuantumParser, the main ideas related to the design and implementation of languages are put forward in an interactive code interpretation interface.
